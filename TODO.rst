TODO Lists
===================

Basics
-----------------
* Add type annotations, as per PEP 484


Needed Features
-----------------
* Setter: Recursive/chain iterset - parallel to iterget. probably contained in recursive.py (possibly in basics.py)
* Deleter: Recursive/chain iterdel - parallel to iterget.
* Provide easy adaptors to allow this to work for objects. Ex. 'get' applied to getting attributes (this is basically the same as the old _tryget) ~ get(vars(obj), names, default=None).
* Fill in examples in README.rst
* Add class description/doc for interfaces: Record, MutableRecord, Discrete, DiscreteRecord, DiscreteMutableRecord
* Add class description/doc for chain.py: SimpleChainRecord, DiscreteChainRecord, ChainRecord


Refactoring
-----------------
* Remove to seperate repoÃŸ: MethodDispatcher

Unittests
----------
* interfaces. Expanded, and refactored into test_interfaces
* Chain: refactor into test_chain.py
* For basics.assert_missing
* For basics.iterget
* For basics.merge: complex. Should test nesting, overriding, etc. Sequences/Mappings, etc
* For basics.pairs
* For basics.indices
* For basics.elements

Packaging
-----------------
* Fill in README.rst - esp examples
* setup.py is ugly

Bugs
-----------
* Standardize handling of 'indexes', across functions. For example, `missing()` does not cast indexes to tuple, but `get()` does.
    * Standardize handling of 'indexes' in chain.ChainRecord
* Functions in basics.py should raise custom Exception types, not builtins.
* basics.pairs, basics.indices, basics.elements: the return type is uncertain. Arrange it to cast to list. Requires smart checking of return type. Sequences[x] --> List[x], Iterable[x] --> List[x], List[x] unchanged, Atomic[x] (non-Sequence) --> List[Atomic[x]].
* chain.ChainRecord: exceptions raised should be custom exception types.
* chain.ChainRecord.iterget: should raise: class RecordIndexError(RecordError, KeyError, IndexError)

Advanced
----------
* recursive.py: function equivalents of __iter__, __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, __eq__, and maybe __contains__, __len__, __missing__.
* Even more advanced: incorporate these methods (recursive versions of __iter__, __getitem__, etc) onto a class `Recursor`, which works like a recursive iterator/viewport around a record.
